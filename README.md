This is a website made by me "Prasenjit Ghose" using HTML, Java, CSS
Now can you take this template to make your own portfolio ?

Of course yes but you have to give proper credits to me.
you have to link back to my github account my github is https://github.com/prasenjitghose36

Tools used by me to complete this portiofolio are:-
HTML5
CSS (sass)
JavaScript
Darkmode was taken from darkmode.js you can see it I have forked the repo.

Thanks-----------------------------------------Any help mail me at prasenjitghose36@gmail.com
